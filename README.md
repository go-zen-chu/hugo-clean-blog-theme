## Install

In your Hugo project, type following.

## How to develop this theme

### Check how theme works with sample project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-zen-chu/hugo-clean-blog-theme-sample
# if you clone repo above you also get stable version theme via submodule
pushd themes/clean-blog
git checkout -b <any-branch-for-development>
# develop your theme

#### Copy css, js and other assets from original bootstrap theme

This theme uses [Start Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog), so we bring all static files to this hugo theme.

```bash
pushd themes/clean-blog
make cp-all
```
